Hello! I am a postdoc in the [Khadempour Lab](https://www.khadlab.com/) at Rutgers University - Newark where I am generally interested in mutualistic microbes facilitating the survival of insect hosts in the context of environmental stressors. I got my PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I worked in the [Currie lab](https://currielab.wisc.edu/) studying the microbes associated with fungus-growing ants.
