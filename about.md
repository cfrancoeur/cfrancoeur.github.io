I was originally born in Toronto, Canada but my family promptly moved and I grew up in Greenbelt, Maryland. I attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School in the Science and Technology Program where I found my biology and microbiology classes to be especially interesting. During my senior year, I was an intern at the United States Department of Agriculture(USDA) in an [Invasive Insect Biocontrol and Behavior Laboratory](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/invasive-insect-biocontrol-behavior-laboratory/) run by Dr. Phyllis Martin. I worked on bacteria that were pathogenic to the brown marmorated stink bug. I characterized the entomopathogenic bacteria using Biolog, phenotypic assays, and 16S rRNA sequencing to distinguish them from the closely-related opportunistic pathogen, *Serratia marcescens*. I got to present my work to the Science and Tech program, our parents, and the various PIs who were involved in our high school's internship program. This experience catalyzed my pursuit towards a career in research as a means to help our environment.

After graduating high school and starting college at the University of Maryland-College Park as a microbiology major, I  joined an [Environmental Microbial and Food Safety Laboratory](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/emfsl/) under Dr. Xiangwu Nou. I worked with Dr. Nancy Liu on biofilm formation of *Ralstonia insidiosa* when it interacted with common foodborne pathogens such as *Escherichia coli*, *Salmonella spp.*, and *Listeria monocytogenes*. We found that *Ralstonia* acts as a bridging bacteria because it promotes the survival and growth of these foodborne pathogens in biofilms. For more details [read our paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/science/article/pii/S0956713516300044)!

During my last two years at UMD, I worked in Dr. Louisa Wu's lab studying *Drosophila melanogaster* innate immunity. I performed a genome wide association study using the [Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel](http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu/)(DGRP) to find genes associated with the phagocytosis of fungi in *Drosophila* hemocytes. Using this technique, we found SNPs in genes that were correlated to reductions in phagocytosis of fungal particles. I really enjoyed working with a classic model system because it was easy to see how this research could benefit people.

## Non-research related interests!
In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and playing ultimate frisbee. 

My favorite author is [Octavia Butler](http://octaviabutler.org/) - her books are truly life-changing! I can't really choose my favorite book, but here are the top three: Parable of the Sower, Parable of the Talents, and Lilith's Brood (technically three books). I recommend any book by Octavia Butler.

I've done sections of the Appalachian Trail and after I get my PhD, I would love to try and tackle a section of the Pacific Crest Trail. I also conquered my first 14er this summer (2017) with my labmates at Mt. Elbert, CO. My life goal is to visit all the National Parks in the United States. So far my favorite one has to be Crater Lake, OR!

I played ultimate frisbee for four years at Maryland, 3 years on [Cosmic](https://umdultimatebee.weebly.com/) and one year on Helpful Corn. I used my last year of eligibility playing on the UW-Madison women's team, [Bella Donna](https://belladonnaatropa.wordpress.com/). I've also played on several different club teams during the summers.

It's really important to have a work-life balance in graduate school and I think it is important to emphasize mental health. While I love science, I also make sure to make time for my other interests!
