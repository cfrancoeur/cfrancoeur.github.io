I was originally born in Toronto, Canada but my family promptly moved and I grew up in Greenbelt, Maryland. I attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School in the Science and Technology Program where I found my biology and microbiology classes to be especially interesting. During my senior year, I was an intern at the United States Department of Agriculture(USDA) in an [Invasive Insect Biocontrol and Behavior Laboratory](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/invasive-insect-biocontrol-behavior-laboratory/) run by Dr. Phyllis Martin. I worked on bacteria that were pathogenic to the brown marmorated stink bug. I characterized the entomopathogenic bacteria using Biolog, phenotypic assays, and 16S rRNA sequencing to distinguish them from the closely-related opportunistic pathogen, *Serratia marcescens*. I got to present my work to the Science and Tech program, our parents, and the various PIs who were involved in our high school's internship program. This experience catalyzed my pursuit towards a career in research as a means to help our environment.

After graduating high school and starting college at the University of Maryland-College Park as a microbiology major, I  joined an [Environmental Microbial and Food Safety Laboratory](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/emfsl/) under Dr. Xiangwu Nou. I worked with Dr. Nancy Liu on biofilm formation of *Ralstonia insidiosa* when it interacted with common foodborne pathogens such as *Escherichia coli*, *Salmonella spp.*, and *Listeria monocytogenes*. We found that *Ralstonia* acts as a bridging bacteria because it promotes the survival and growth of these foodborne pathogens in biofilms. For more details [read our paper](../images/Liu_2016_foodcontrol.pdf)!

During my last two years at UMD, I worked in Dr. Louisa Wu's lab studying *Drosophila melanogaster* innate immunity. I performed a genome wide association study using the [Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel](http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu/)(DGRP) to find genes associated with the phagocytosis of fungi in *Drosophila* hemocytes. Using this technique, we found SNPs in genes that were correlated to reductions in phagocytosis of fungal particles. I really enjoyed working with a classic model system because it was easy to see how this research could benefit people.

I received my PhD from UW-Madison, where I worked in the Currie Lab, which focuses on fungus-farming ants as a model system to answer a wide range of evolutionary and ecological questions. The main components of the ant-microbe symbiosis are pictured below. The ants have an obligate mutualism with a fungal cultivar. The ants bring substrate (e.g. leaves, insect frass, decaying vegetation) to the fungus, which then breaks the substrate down for the ants to eat! Just like in human agriculture, the ants' crop (the fungal cultivar) has some natural enemies. *Escovopsis* is a fungal pathogen that inhibits the growth of the ants' fungal cultivar.  Over millions of years, the ants have developed a way to control *Escovopsis* with another symbiont, *Pseudonocardia*. *Pseudonocardia* is an [actinobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria) that grows on the bodies of the ants. *Pseudonocardia* secretes secondary metabolites (i.e. antibiotics) that kill *Escovopsis*, which can be seen by the lack of growth surrounding the colony of *Pseudonocardia* in the *Escovopsis* picture! As a result of all these complex relationships, we can study a wide variety of things, from antibiotic resistance to plant degradation for biofuels!

I investigated the *other* associations in the fungus-farming ants. Specifically, I wanted to know what other microbes are contributing to the symbiosis and how this allows for fungus-farming ants to adapt to their environment. Using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods, I explored the ability of fungus garden bacteria to detoxify plant secondary compounds that are harmful to the fungal mutualist ([Francoeur et al., 2020](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.02146-20)), I investigated the role of fungus garden-associated bacteria in the genus *Burkholderia* as potential defensive symbionts that protect the ants against the parasitic fungus *Escovopsis*([Francoeur, May et al., 2021](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/AEM.00178-21)), and I identified 34 eukaryotic viruses associated with either ant or fungal tissue.

Currently, I am a postdoc in the Khadempour Lab studying the microbiome of honeypot ants. For more information on what I am researching now, click [here](https://cfrancoeur.github.io/research/).

## Non-research related interests!
In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, biking, and playing ultimate frisbee. 

My favorite author is [Octavia Butler](http://octaviabutler.org/) - her books are truly life-changing! I can't really choose my favorite book, but here are the top three: Parable of the Sower, Parable of the Talents, and Lilith's Brood (technically three books). I recommend any book by Octavia Butler.

I've done sections of the Appalachian Trail and after I get my PhD, I would love to try and tackle a section of the Pacific Crest Trail. I also conquered my first 14er this summer (2017) with my labmates at Mt. Elbert, CO. My life goal is to visit all the National Parks in the United States. So far my favorite one has to be Crater Lake, OR!

I played ultimate frisbee for four years at Maryland, 3 years on [Cosmic](https://umdultimatebee.weebly.com/) and one year on Helpful Corn. I used my last year of eligibility playing on the UW-Madison women's team, [Bella Donna](https://belladonnaatropa.wordpress.com/). I've also played on several different club teams during the summers and got to go to Women's Club Nationals in San Diego in 2018 with [Heist](https://www.heistultimate.com/).

It's really important to have a work-life balance. While I love science, I also make sure to make time for my other interests!
