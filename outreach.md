## *The Wonderful World of Microbes* Zine  
![](../images/title_page.png =100x20) 
In 2021, as a part of my participation in the [WISCIENCE Public Service Fellows program](https://wiscience.wisc.edu/program/public-service-fellows), I wrote a zine (illustrated by [Lindsey Leigh](https://www.lindseyleighart.com/)) in partnership with the [UW-Madison Arboretum](https://arboretum.wisc.edu/) to communicate the widespread influence of microbes on Earth. The zine highlights microbes in areas of health and the environment: from antibiotics, to symbiotic relationships in nature, to wastewater, to the role of microbes in ecological communities like wetlands, prairies, and forests. 

The zine is freely available and can be downloaded from [this Arboretum webpage](https://arboretum.wisc.edu/learn/resources/). Enjoy the PDF on your computer or phone in consecutive pages, or print it out as a booklet! Please feel free to share with anybody who would be interested!!
